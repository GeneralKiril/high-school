        <h2>Reality Is Ruining the Humanoid Robot Hype</h2>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Over the next several</strong>years, humanoid robots will change the nature of work. Or at least, that’s
        what humanoid robotics companies have
        been consistently promising, enabling them to raise hundreds of millions of dollars at valuations that run into
        the billions.</p>
    <p>Delivering on these promises will require a lot of robots. Agility Robotics expects to ship “hundreds” of its
        Digit robots in 2025 and has a factory in Oregon capable of building over 10,000 robots per year. Tesla is
        planning to produce 5,000 of its Optimus robots in 2025, and at least 50,000 in 2026. Figure believes “there is
        a path to 100,000 robots” by 2029. And these are just three of the largest companies in an increasingly crowded
        space.</p>
    <p>Amplifying this message are many financial analysts: Bank of America Global Research, for example, predicts that
        global humanoid robot shipments will reach 18,000 units in 2025. And Morgan Stanley Research estimates that by
        2050 there could be over 1 billion humanoid robots, part of a US $5 trillion market.</p>
    <p>But as of now, the market for humanoid robots is almost entirely hypothetical. Even the most successful companies
        in this space have deployed only a small handful of robots in carefully controlled pilot projects. And future
        projections seem to be based on an extraordinarily broad interpretation of jobs that a capable, efficient, and
        safe humanoid robot—which does not currently exist—might conceivably be able to do. Can the current reality
        connect with the promised scale?</p>
